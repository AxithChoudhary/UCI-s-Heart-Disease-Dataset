# UCI-s-Heart-Disease-Dataset

## About
This dataset is a multivariate dataset containing a variety of separate mathematical or statistical variables, which is suitable for multivariate numerical data analysis. It comprises 14 attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest), the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, and Thalassemia.

While the original dataset includes 76 attributes, only a subset of 14 attributes has been used in published studies to date. The Cleveland database is the only dataset used by machine learning researchers so far. The main objective of analyzing this dataset is to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the given attributes. Additionally, the dataset can be used for experimental tasks to diagnose and gain insights that could help to better understand the problem.
